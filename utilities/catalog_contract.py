"""Local queue-name adapter over the two source-owned catalog-events producers.

Per ADR 0005, "Source-owned catalog ingestion repositories"
(https://github.com/groovemap-music/design/blob/main/docs/adr/0005-source-owned-catalog-ingestion.md),
`groovemap.catalog-events/v1` is produced independently by `discogs-ingestion` and
`musicbrainz-ingestion`; there is no combined upstream to generate a single binding from.
Both producer contracts and their generated Python bindings are promoted byte-for-byte
into `contracts/catalog-events/v1/discogs/` and `contracts/catalog-events/v1/musicbrainz/`
(see each subdirectory's `source.json`, digest-verified by `scripts/check-contracts.py`).

This module is the toolkit's hand-authored adapter, not a generated binding. Every utility
that needs an AMQP identifier imports it from here rather than reaching into a promoted
producer binding: the promoted bindings ship under `contracts/`, outside the installed
`utilities` wheel, and each exposes only `exchange_name(entity)` and
`queue_name(consumer, entity)` for its own source with no dead-letter helpers. The adapter
therefore composes both sources under one import and reconstructs
`dead_letter_exchange_name` / `dead_letter_queue_name` from the same `.dlx` / `.dlq`
templates both promoted contracts' `queue` sections define.

ADR 0005 freezes every runtime AMQP identifier produced here across a producer promotion.
`tests/test_catalog_contract_frozen_identifiers.py` snapshots them against both promoted
contracts' `runtime_identifiers` blocks, so a promotion that shifts a durable name fails
immediately rather than orphaning a queue that already holds messages.
